## Project Title
Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews for McDonald’s Orlando

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews of McDonald’s Orlando, the largest McDonald’s branch in the world. The main objective is to extract insights from customer feedback to understand overall satisfaction and identify common themes associated with positive, negative, and neutral experiences.

The dataset consists of 460 reviews collected from online sources. Each review was preprocessed using text-cleaning techniques, including removal of mentions, hashtags, punctuation, numbers, and conversion to lowercase. After preprocessing, sentiment classification was performed using a large language model, categorizing each review as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

The project also includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize sentiment distributions and identify the most frequently mentioned words associated with each sentiment. Visualizations such as pie charts, bar charts, and top-word analyses help communicate the findings effectively.

The results of this analysis can be used by McDonald’s management to better understand customer perceptions, improve service quality, and enhance customer satisfaction.
